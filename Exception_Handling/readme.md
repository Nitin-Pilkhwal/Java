# Exception Handling in Java

Exception handling is an important concept in Java programming that allows developers to handle and manage errors or exceptional situations that may occur during the execution of a program. By using exception handling, developers can gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.

## Types of Exceptions

In Java, exceptions can be classified into two main categories: user-defined exceptions and built-in exceptions.

### User-Defined Exceptions

User-defined exceptions, also known as custom exceptions, are exceptions that are created by the programmer to handle specific error conditions in their code. These exceptions are derived from the base class `Exception` or one of its subclasses. By creating custom exceptions, developers can provide more meaningful error messages and handle specific error scenarios in their applications.

### Built-In Exceptions

Java provides a set of built-in exceptions that cover a wide range of common error scenarios. These exceptions are part of the Java Standard Library and are organized in a hierarchy, with the base class `Throwable` at the top. Some commonly used built-in exceptions include `NullPointerException`, `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`, `ArithmeticException`, and `FileNotFoundException`, among others. These exceptions are designed to handle specific error conditions that may occur during the execution of a Java program.
